this challenge is code refactoring. we got starter code and our objective is to refactor the code to give the elements more specific semantics. also we had to consolidate repetitive code to simplify it. there were some hyperlinks we have to link and give give description to alt images. once you finished working on the code you refresh the page to make sure that it still looked the same and that all links were working properly.
